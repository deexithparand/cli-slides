## Motivation for OrgGuard
###### Why We Built This
- Managing GitHub user naming standards was a mess.
- Users had inconsistent names like `ideexith`, `i_am_deexith`, `kickbuttowski`.
- Unused invites consumed costly license spaces.
- No easy way to automate audits and enforce policies.
- **Solution**: Policy enforcement on GitHub using **OPA + Webhooks + Grafana**.

---

## Tech Flow
###### How OrgGuard Works
1. **GitHub Webhook in Golang**
2. **Ngrok** for exposing local services
3. **Webhook Route** for handling GitHub events
4. **Trigger on Member Add/Invite**
5. **Send Data to OPA for Policy Validation**
6. **Store Violations in PostgreSQL**
7. **Visualize Everything on Grafana**

## OrgGuard: The Setup
###### A Simple Yet Powerful Model
- GitHub Webhooks â†’ Golang Backend â†’ OPA Policy Check â†’ PostgreSQL â†’ Grafana Dashboard

## Why Self-Host OrgGuard?
